# URL Shortener

App to shorten URLs.

## Development

Use `yarn dev` to run the development server.
This will start both the REST API, along with serving all the pages from NextJS.

## Build

The project can be build with `yarn build`.
As it requires a server, it can be executed with `yarn start`.

## TODO

- [ ] Enable configuration of data store for URLs
- [ ] Add linting
- [ ] Enable Docker support
